# Grouping Pulses and 2-vs-3 Birhythms

Once an even pulse is established, the next step is to **organize pulses into groups**.  
This is the beginning of rhythm — before notation, before hierarchy, before meter.

Outside of formal study, musicians often blur terms like “beat,” “pulse,” “meter,” and “rhythm.”  
Here, we begin with the cleanest possible foundation:

- **Pulse**: equal temporal points with no imposed structure  
- **Grouping**: the first layer of structure applied to pulses

No hierarchy, no accents, no strong/weak relationships — only **pulses arranged in small units**.

---

## Why Grouping Happens

Music psychology shows that humans rarely perceive long sequences of identical pulses as undifferentiated. Instead, the mind imposes structure:

> “When humans hear evenly spaced identical sounds, the mind automatically groups them —  
> most often into pairs (‘tick–tock’).” <sup>1</sup>

This tendency suggests that grouping is not only a musical device but also a basic cognitive response.

## Basic Group Types

Across many musical traditions, the simplest and most widespread group sizes are:

- groups of **2 pulses**
- groups of **3 pulses**

These groupings become the raw material for more complex rhythmic structures.

What matters here is not notation or meter — only the idea that pulses can be intentionally collected together.

---

## Hemiola (2s and 3s Together)

A **hemiola** occurs when 2-pulse groupings and 3-pulse groupings coexist or alternate over the same underlying pulse.

At this stage we are *not* using meter or accent.  
We are simply experiencing how different groupings interact.

- 2-groups emphasize a feeling of **even subdivision**
- 3-groups emphasize a feeling of **extended reach**

Neither is accented; neither is “strong” or “weak.”  
The *interaction of the grouping lengths alone* creates the effect.

## Birhythm Foundations: 2-Against-3 Through Counting

This course follows a coordination approach adapted from percussion pedagogy and *Ancient Traditions – Future Possibilities*:

### 1. Count aloud **1-2-3-4-5-6** steadily

This reinforces the underlying pulse (six evenly spaced points).

### 2. Tap the **primary-hand pattern** (3-group)

Tap on: **1, 3, 5**

This creates equal spacing every two pulses.

### 3. Tap the **non-primary-hand pattern** (2-group)

Tap on: **1, 4**

This creates equal spacing every three pulses.

### 4. Combine them (the 2-against-3 coordination)

- Both hands tap **1**
- Primary hand taps **3, 5**
- Secondary hand taps **4**

This is the cleanest motor-skills version of 2-vs-3 without introducing meter or hierarchy.

We focus only on **the grouping logic**, not its later notational equivalents.

## Optional Practice Audio (Click-Tracks)

You may practice with these steady click-tracks, each cycling through six pulses:

**Pulse Only**  
`pulse-6.mp3`

**Group of 3 (1–3–5)**  
`group3-click.mp3`

**Group of 2 (1–4)**  
`group2-click.mp3`

**Superimposed 2-vs-3**  
`23-birhythm-click.mp3`

(These will load automatically once uploaded to the site’s `/assets/audio/` folder.)

## Interactive Grouping Tool

Experiment with grouping pulses, creating 2- and 3-patterns, and layering them:

{% include lab-embed.html src="/theory-iv-lab/pulse-grouping-lab.html?embed=1" %}

Use this tool to build intuition for grouping before we introduce notation, timelines, or Euclidean rhythms.

---

## Homework (Short Assignment)

Create **four unique grouping patterns**, each at least **16 pulses** long:

- Use the Pulse Grouping Lab to design each pattern.
- Export each one using “Export as Text.”
- Submit all four text files to Moodle.

**Grading (fast rubric):**

| Criteria | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Clear grouping logic (2s, 3s, or mixed) | 4 |
| Clean structure (no accidental overlaps) | 4 |
| Variety between examples | 2 |

*(10 points total.)*
