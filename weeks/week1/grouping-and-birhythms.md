# Grouping Interactions and Bi-rhythms

Once we can organize pulses into groups of 2 and 3, we can begin exploring what happens when
different groupings occur over the same pulse. This creates some of the most characteristic rhythmic
effects found across musical cultures.

This page combines two ideas:

- how groupings interact (including what is often called *hemiola*)
- how two grouping processes can occur simultaneously as ratios

We approach these concepts without meter, beats, or notation—only pulse, grouping, and time.

## 1. Pulse and Grouping (Short Review)

A pulse is an evenly spaced sequence of temporal points.  
A grouping is a way of organizing those pulses into small structural units.

The simplest and most widely used groupings are:

- groups of 2 pulses  
- groups of 3 pulses

These form the basic building blocks out of which more complex rhythmic ideas emerge.

### Example: 2 and 3 over 12 pulses

| Pulse | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Group 2 | X | . | X | . | X | . | X | . | X | . | X | . |
| Group 3 | X | . | . | X | . | . | X | . | . | X | . | . |

## 2. Interaction of Groupings

When 2-pulse and 3-pulse groupings occur in close succession or in layers,
we perceive a shift in the organization of time. This effect is often called a
hemiola, but here we simply treat it as two different ways of grouping the same pulse.

### Short Embodied Exercise

1. Tap a steady pulse.  
2. Group every 2nd pulse with one hand.  
3. Then group every 3rd pulse.  
4. Switch back and forth.

The goal is not mastery, but perceiving how different groupings create different emergent patterns.

## 3. Bi-rhythms as Ratios

A bi-rhythm occurs when two grouping processes happen simultaneously over the same pulse.
We describe these interactions as ratios:

- 2:3  
- 3:4  
- 4:5  

This keeps the concepts clear and avoids meter terminology. The focus is simply on
coexisting temporal organizations.

## 4. The Core Ratio: 2:3

The 2:3 relation is the most important because:

- grouping in 2 is cognitively natural  
- grouping in 3 requires an intentional reorganization of the pulse  
- their interaction creates a clear pattern of coincidence and non-coincidence  

### 2:3 over 12 pulses

| Pulse | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|
| Group 2 | X | . | X | . | X | . | X | . | X | . | X | . |
| Group 3 | X | . | . | X | . | . | X | . | . | X | . | . |

This experience prepares students for later topics such as emergent rhythm, Euclidean structures,
and metric reinterpretation.

## 5. Additional Ratios (Conceptual Only)

### 3:4 over 12 pulses

| Group 3 | X | . | . | X | . | . | X | . | . | X | . | . |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Group 4 | X | . | . | . | X | . | . | . | X | . | . | . |

## Summary

- Pulse is the even temporal foundation.  
- Groupings organize pulses into small structural units.  
- Interactions of groupings produce contrasting rhythmic structures.  
- A bi-rhythm is two grouping processes occurring simultaneously.  
- 2:3 is the core experiential ratio; others extend the concept.
