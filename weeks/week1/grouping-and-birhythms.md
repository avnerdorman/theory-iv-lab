# Bi-Rhythms and Vertical Hemiola
These exercises follow directly from **Grouping Pulses** and introduce the idea of **two simultaneous grouping cycles** occurring over the same steady pulse.

There is:

- no meter  
- no beat  
- no hierarchy  
- no notation

Everything is built from one shared **isochronous pulse**, grouped in different ways.

The terms used here:

- **Primary Hand** = your dominant or naturally coordinated hand  
- **Non-Primary Hand** = the other hand  

The primary hand taps **1–3–5** (3-grouping),  
The non-primary hand taps **1** (2-grouping across the same six pulses).

This produces what we call the **vertical hemiola**.

# 1. Foundation: Saying 1–6 and Tapping 3-Group / 2-Group
This is the core skill:

1. Say **1 2 3 4 5 6** evenly with a pulse.
2. Tap the **primary hand** on **1, 3, 5**.
3. Tap the **non-primary hand** on **1**.

This creates:

- **3 taps** in the primary hand  
- **2 taps** in the non-primary hand  
- **over the same 6 pulses**

# 2. Vertical Hemiola Exercises  
These match your original Google Sites/docx tables.

---

## **Vertical Hemiola Exercise I**
Count steadily.  
Tap the **primary hand** on **1, 3, 5**, and the **non-primary hand** on **1**.

| Non-Primary Hand | Count | Primary Hand |
|------------------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
|   | 2 |   |
|   | 3 | 3 |
|   | 4 |   |
|   | 5 | 5 |
|   | 6 |   |

---

## **Vertical Hemiola Exercise II**

| Non-Primary Hand | Count | Primary Hand |
|------------------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
|   | 2 |   |
|   | 3 | 3 |
|   | 4 |   |
|   | 5 | 5 |
|   | 6 |   |

---

## **Vertical Hemiola Exercise III**

| Non-Primary Hand | Count | Primary Hand |
|------------------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
|   | 2 | 2 |
|   | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 | 4 |
|   | 5 | 5 |
|   | 6 | 6 |

---

## **Vertical Hemiola Exercise V**
Shift your awareness to the **non-primary hand** and count with it.

| Non-Primary Hand | Count | Primary Hand |
|------------------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| . | . | . |
| . | . | . |
| 2 | 2 | 2 |
| . | . | . |
| . | . | . |
|   | 3 | 3 |

Dots = silent motions or unaccented taps, matching your original tables.

# 3. Moving from Hemiola to Bi-Rhythms  
Once the 2-vs-3 vertical hemiola is comfortable, we extend the same logic:

- One shared pulse
- Two different grouping cycles
- No meter or beat
- No notation

Just **patterns** unfolding across time.

---

# 4. Bi-Rhythm Extension: 4 Against 3 (No Meter)

We avoid time signatures entirely.

Use a **12-pulse cycle**.

### Step 1 — Count the 12 pulses
