# Practicing Bi-Rhythms (2-and-3 Coordination)

This page follows directly from our work with **pulse** and **pulse groupings**.  
Here we begin training the coordination needed for **2-and-3 bi-rhythms**, using only:

- counting evenly from **1 to 6**
- tapping with the **primary-use hand** (your dominant hand)
- tapping with the **secondary-use hand**
- **no beats**, no meter, no hierarchy, and no notation

Everything is still grounded in **pulse** and **groupings**.

## 1. Count 1–6 and Tap 3-Groupings (Primary Hand)

Count evenly:

**1 2 3 4 5 6**

Tap your **primary-use hand** (right for most students) on:

- 1  
- 3  
- 5  

This produces a **3-grouping over 6 pulses**.

| Left Hand | Count | Right Hand |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1         | 1      | 1          |
|           | 2      |            |
|           | 3      | 3          |
|           | 4      |            |
|           | 5      | 5          |
|           | 6      |            |

---

## 2. Count 1–6 and Tap 2-Groupings (Secondary Hand)

Using the **same counting**, now tap your **secondary-use hand** on:

- 1  
- 4  

This produces a **2-grouping over 6 pulses**.

| Left Hand | Count | Right Hand |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1         | 1      | 1          |
|           | 2      |            |
|           | 3      |            |
| 4         | 4      |            |
|           | 5      |            |
|           | 6      |            |

## 3. Combine Both — 3-Over-2 Bi-Rhythm

Now perform both patterns **at the same time**, using:

- primary hand: taps on **1, 3, 5**
- secondary hand: taps on **1, 4**
- same verbal counting **1–6**

This is now a **bi-rhythm** built entirely from *groupings of pulse*.

| Left Hand | Count | Right Hand |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1         | 1      | 1          |
|           | 2      |            |
|           | 3      |            |
| 4         | 4      | 4          |
|           | 5      |            |
|           | 6      |            |

## 4. Extended Bi-Rhythm Practice (Optional)

These longer cycles come directly from the same principle:  
**count evenly, place groupings at fixed positions, then combine.**

### Example: 3 over a 12-pulse cycle

| Left Hand | Count | Right Hand |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1         | 1      | 1          |
|           | 2      |            |
|           | 3      | 3          |
| 4         | 4      |            |
|           | 5      |            |
|           | 6      | 6          |
| 7         | 7      |            |
|           | 8      |            |
|           | 9      | 9          |
| 10        | 10     |            |
|           | 11     |            |
|           | 12     | 12         |

### Example: Larger 20-pulse pattern

This is simply another extension of the same tap-on-fixed-positions idea:

| Left Hand | Count | Right Hand |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1         | 1      | 1          |
|           | 2      |            |
|           | 3      |            |
| 4         | 4      |            |
|           | 5      | 5          |
| 6         | 6      |            |
|           | 7      |            |
|           | 8      |            |
| 9         | 9      | 9          |
|           | 10     |            |
| 11        | 11     |            |
|           | 12     |            |
|           | 13     | 13         |
| 14        | 14     |            |
|           | 15     |            |
| 16        | 16     |            |
|           | 17     | 17         |
| 18        | 18     |            |
|           | 19     |            |
|           | 20     |            |
