# Music Theory IV – Instructor Style & Pedagogy Guide  
Author: Avner Dorman  
Purpose: Provide a stable reference for tone, conceptual rigor, and course philosophy, while remaining flexible enough to support ongoing course development and improvement.

## 1. Course Philosophy (Stable, But Not Static)

This course follows a rhythm-first approach and emphasizes conceptual clarity before terminology.  
However, the exact sequence, examples, and emphases may evolve from semester to semester.

**This document is not a fixed curriculum.**  
It is a guidance framework so that any new materials produced with assistance (Codex/GPT) remain consistent with:

- the instructor’s voice  
- the instructor’s preferred definitions  
- the instructor’s theoretical standards  
- the instructor's long-term pedagogical goals  

Even when the content itself changes.

## 2. Core Pedagogical Values (Always Maintain)

### Clarity Before Complexity
Introduce ideas in a clean conceptual order.  
Avoid mixing terms (pulse/beat/meter) prematurely.

### Precision of Language
Use only terms students have been formally taught.  
Avoid ambiguous or overly casual usage of rhythm vocabulary.

### Conceptual Foundations Before Notation
Students should experience and understand an idea before seeing how it is notated formally.

### Cross-Cultural Validity
When possible, use definitions that work across Western, non-Western, historical, and contemporary practice.

## 3. Stable Theoretical Touchstones

The following definitions and perspectives form the “baseline” theoretical stance that all generated material must respect unless the instructor explicitly chooses to alter it.

### Pulse
- Evenly spaced temporal points used to conceptualize the flow of time.  
- Not inherently cyclic or hierarchical.  
- Basis for grouping, not equivalent to beat or meter.

### Grouping
- The first pattern-forming process applied to pulse.  
- No hierarchy or metric structure yet.  
- Groups of **2** and **3** are cognitively fundamental across cultures.

### Hemiola
- The interaction of 2-pulse and 3-pulse groupings over the same pulse.  
- Not tied to Western bar structures when first introduced.

### Timelines
- Defined in the ethnomusicological sense: a recurring rhythmic pattern functioning as a structural anchor.  
- Different from pulse.

### Euclidean / Maximally Even Rhythms
- Treated mathematically and musically, following Toussaint.

### Transformational Thinking
- Rotation, shifting, and phase relationships are permitted but introduced progressively.

If the instructor changes any of these definitions, this guide should be updated.

## 4. Voice & Tone (Non-Negotiable)

All generated lesson prose must:

- sound like the instructor  
- avoid artificial “academic padding”  
- remain direct, clear, and conceptually grounded  
- avoid stylistic embellishments or rhetorical flourishes  
- use examples only when musically and pedagogically relevant  

**Voice characteristics:**

- Direct, clean, conversational but precise  
- Never dismissive  
- No unnecessary adjectives  
- Uses examples sparingly  
- Allows students to reason from first principles  

Example tone:
> “Pulse gives us the raw material. Grouping gives us the beginnings of rhythm.”

## 5. Flexibility for Course Evolution

This guide **must not limit** the ability to:

- reorder topics  
- add or remove assignments  
- introduce new technology or interactive tools  
- integrate new repertoire  
- refine definitions  
- expand certain modules (e.g., timelines, jazz harmony, modernist set theory)  
- experiment with cross-cultural comparisons  
- adjust pacing or depth  

Codex/GPT may propose structural or pedagogical improvements, **but must always:**

- preserve the instructor’s theoretical foundations  
- avoid introducing unverified or speculative music theory  
- label any suggestions as suggestions, not assertions  
- await instructor confirmation before assuming a change in doctrine  

---

## 6. Authoritative Sources

The following authors/works may be referenced or reinforced:

- Simha Arom  
- Godfried Thomas Toussaint  
- Fred Lerdahl & Ray Jackendoff  
- Justin London  
- Kofi Agawu  
- Harald Krebs  
- Relevant African, Afro-diasporic, Indian, and gamelan scholarship  

AI systems must not fabricate citations or claim support from sources not explicitly listed unless the instructor explicitly adds to the list.

---

## 7. What This Document Is NOT

- It is **not** a binding syllabus  
- It is **not** a final definition of the course content  
- It is **not** a limitation on innovation  
- It is **not** a full theoretical treatise  

It is simply the **guardrails** ensuring that AI-generated or AI-assisted materials stay:

- theoretically correct  
- pedagogically coherent  
- in your voice  
- compatible with the long-term structure of the course  

---

## 8. Instructor Override

Any instruction in this guide may be overridden by:

1. A direct request from the instructor  
2. A revision to the course structure  
3. A new pedagogical direction  

Codex/GPT must always defer to the most recent instructor guidance.
